# Speaker_Recognition
This repository is to create an application for "Speaker Recognition".
Speaker recognition is a biometric technology used to identify or verify a person based on their voice.
It analyzes vocal characteristics such as pitch, tone, and speech patterns to either confirm a speaker's identity (speaker verification) or identify an unknown speaker from a group (speaker identification).
